        <h2 id="spag-procedure">Procedure;</h2>
        <p>Typically, you prepare Jollof spaghetti by simmering the pasta in a flavourful, spicy tomato-based sauce similar to jollof rice.<br>
               You make the sauce with a blend of onion, tomato, pepper, and spices such as curry powder, thyme, and bay leaves.<br> Next, the spaghetti cooks in the sauce until completely absorbed, giving it a rich, bright red hue and richness.<br> 
               Enjoy this versatile dish alone or serve it as a side dish with grilled or fried chicken, beef, or fish.
